I am a fourth-year PhD Candidate from the College of Computer Science and Technology, [Zhejiang University](https://www.zju.edu.cn/). I am very fortunate to be advised by [Prof. Zhao](https://lvpgroup.github.io/) of LVP Lab (Logic, Verification, and Programming Lab) from the College of Computer Science, Zhejiang University. Before that, I received a BS in Physics (Honors Program) from [Xi'an Jiaotong University](https://www.xjtu.edu.cn/). I also went to Michigan State University as an exchange student to learn physics.

My research interests include formal verification, theorem proving, large language models, proof automation, operating systems, and trusted execution environments. I am now interested in AI for formal methods. Specifically, I am focusing on automatically specifying and verifying the system security and safety (e.g., Trusted execution environment) in Isabelle/HOL with the assistance of LLMs. Before that, I verified the TEE and its protection profile with Isabelle/HOL.   

Now I am a visiting PhD student at the University of Illinois at Urbana Champaign (UIUC) under Professor [Talia Ringer](https://dependenttyp.es/)'s guidance.
