I am a third-year PhD Candidate from the College of Computer Science and Technology, [Zhejiang University](https://www.zju.edu.cn/). I am very fortunate to be advised by [Prof. Zhao](https://lvpgroup.github.io/) of LVP Lab (Logic, Verification, and Programming Lab) from the College of Computer Science, Zhejiang University. Before that, I received a BS in Physics (Honors Program) from [Xi'an Jiaotong University](https://www.xjtu.edu.cn/).

My research interests include formal verification, theorem proving, large language models, proof automation, operating systems, and trusted execution environments. I am now interested in AI for formal methods. Specifically, I am focusing on automatically specifying and verifying the system security and safety (e.g., Trusted execution environment) in Isabelle/HOL with the assistance of LLMs. Before that, I verified the TEE and its protection profile with Isabelle/HOL.   

I went to Michigan State University as an exchange student during my undergraduate and I wish to travel to the United States again as a visiting PhD student.
